<h1>Project-30</h1>

<p><b>Project-30</b> is my first attempt to build an functional <b>Angular2</b> app, with <b>Firebase</b> as a backend.
The purpose of the app is to help people to build better habits.
This is accomplished through a commitment for 30 days to one specific behaviour.
It could be running, taking a cold shower, reading or taking a photo <i>everyday</i>.</p>
<p><i>All it takes is commitment and willpower.</i></p>
Have fun! :)
